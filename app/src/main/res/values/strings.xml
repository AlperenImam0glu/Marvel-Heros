    <string name="desc">In Forest Hills, Queens, New York, high school student Peter Parker is an orphaned scientist who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He is bitten by a radioactive spider at a scientific exhibit and acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid. Along with super strength, Parker gains the ability to walk on walls and ceilings.
        Through his native ability for science, he develops a device that allows him to cast artificial webs. Initially seeking to capitalize on his newfound abilities, Parker creates a suit and, as Spider-Man, becomes a television star.</string>
